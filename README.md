## Introduction

This paper presents an improved Yolov8 's framework for PPE detection. We propose I-GAM attention modules incorporated with Yolov8 architecture to highlight significant information.  Additonally, the modified Improved Global Attention Mechanism (I-GAM) was inserted in the head of Yolo network to enhance feature representation

## Color Helmet and Vest (CHV)  Dataset

In our experiment, we used dataset **Color Helmet and Vest (CHV)**, which included 170 images with 345 labeled pedestrians



The dataset is open for free use, raw data download at (https://github.com/ZijianWang-ZW/PPE_detection) or data which already processed (https://universe.roboflow.com/hienlongairesearch/chv_dataset_train_officially ). 




## Results

- **YOLO v8 outperform when compare with others method 's research.**
